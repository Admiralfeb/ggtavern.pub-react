        DM: You make a wrong turn and end up in the 404 Goblin workshop. Grumpy
        has a toy he wants to try on you. It looks like it might hurt if it
        bites. Gabby looks like she's itching for a fight ... or a meal, either
        way, those eyes spell danger. If anything happens to you, you won't be
        found.
      </p>
      <p>

        <Link to='/home' component={NavLink}>
          home
        </Link>{' '}
        if you want to avoid being dinner.
