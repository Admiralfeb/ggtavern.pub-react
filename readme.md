# GGTavern.pub - React

This repo is the source code for the MERN website of (unofficial) Grinning Goblin Gaming Tavern.

I, Admiralfeb, fell in love with the Tavern when I started visiting in November of 2018.

I wanted to build them a site commensurate to the fun that was had there.

My first attempt was using Angular. While it looks fine, my second attempt, this time using React looks much better. Sadly, Goblin in the form I was introduced to it was not long for this world where covid reigns.

My hope is that the owners of Goblin will accept this website as a gift and have me as their webdev once Goblin rises from the ashes of 2020.

## Hosted

The website is hosted on my domain at <https://ggtavern.admiralfeb.net>.

## Structure/Technologies

This website is built using the MERN framework

- MongoDB Atlas
- Express
- React
- Node

and is hosted on Heroku.

I'm using TypeScript whereever I can and there's a Go script in there too in the root/img directory for writing my JSON files that get uploaded into the database.

With React, I chose to use only Function components because hooks are amazing. It makes it alot easier in Typescript so I don't have to define types **EVERYWHERE**.

There is only one scss file in the entire project as I chose to use jss to be in line with the Material-Ui system.
